 *  In this header file we have two classes: SBoard and SudokuPlayerBoard.
 *
 *  The former represents only the board data, as a matrix of short.
 *
 *  The latter represents the board and the actions necessary to support
 *  the player's moves and all the information associated with a
 *  Sudoku match. This involves enconding information regarding incorrect
 *  moves, invalid plays, correct play, original numbers, etc.
 *  These information is required to display the board with special colors
 *  representing all thesse different conditions.

    /*!
     *  This class represents a Sudoku board as the player's makes his or her moves during a match.
     *  The moves in the board data set is coded as follows:
     *
     *  + Digits in range [1,9]: These are the original values already filled in when the match started.
     *  + 0: An empty location that may receive a value provided by the player.
     *  + prefix `1` as in 1[1,9]: We add this prefix if the player's value is correct, i.e. corresponds
     *    to the correct value stored in the solution elsewhere.
     *  + prefix `2` as in 2[1,9]: We add this prefix if the player's value is incorrect, i.e. it is
     *    a valid play but it differs from the solution.
     *  + prefix `3` as in 3[1,9]: We add this prefix if the player makes an invalid move, i.e. a move
     *    that breaks the Sudoku's basic rules.
     *
     *  Note that the player's moves are always stored, when it is applied to a location that does
     *  not contain an original value.
     *  This is important so we can color the number accordingly when we display the board.
