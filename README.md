# Intro

This project implements a terminal version of the Sudoku game.

The **full description** of the project may be found [**here**](docs/sudoku_interativo.pdf).

# The game

According to the [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku):

> Sudoku is a logic-based, combinatorial number-placement puzzle.
> The objective is to fill a 9×9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3×3 subgrids that compose the grid (also called "boxes", "blocks", or "regions") contain all of the digits from 1 to 9.
> The puzzle setter provides a partially completed grid, which for a well-posed puzzle has a single solution.

The Sudoku rules are:

1. Each row, column, and nonet can contain each number (typically 1 to 9) exactly once.
2. The sum of all numbers in any nonet, row, or column must be equal to 45.
